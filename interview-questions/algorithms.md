## Algorithms

### Arrays

- Find missing number in array of continuous elements from 1 to n.
- Sort a given array
- Sort elements by frequency in an array
- Merge 2 sorted arrays
- Merge 2 unsorted arrays
- Find median of 2 sorted arrays
- Max sum such that no 2 elements are adjacent
- Check if array contains a number
- Find largest and smallest number in an unsorted array
- Find pairs whose sum is equal to given sum
- Find repetitive numbers in array if it contains duplicates
- Remove duplicate elements from an array
- Find an element which repeated only once while all others repeated twice
- Find top 2 elements from unsorted array
- Rearrange positive and negetive numbers in sorted order
- Find sub array with max sum in an array of pos and neg number
- Find length of longest sequence in an array
- Reverse an array

### LinkedList

- LinkedList vs Array
- Length of LinkedList (recursive/iterative)
- Search an element in LinkedList

- Merge 2 LinkedList's into one
- Delete Nodes which has greater value on rightside
- Delete middle nodes of LinkedList
- QuickSort on singly LinkedList
- Remove duplicates from LinkedList
- Move last node to front node in LinkedList
- Swap every 2 nodes in LinkedList
- Delete alternate nodes of LinkedList
- Find frequency of given number in LinkedList
- Sum of 2 LinkedList using stack
- Sum of 2 LinkedList using recursion
