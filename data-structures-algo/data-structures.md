## Data Structures

### Arrays

Collection of elements. Also called with names Vectors, Tuples.
    - One dimensional array
    - Two dimensional array
    
####Usage
- Used to implement lookup tables.
- Implement lists and Strings.
- Many databases consist of 1-D arrays whose elements are records.
- Implment heaps, hash tables, deques, queues, stacks and VLists.

####Types of Arrays
- Static Arrays (fixed size)
  - Have O(1) insertion, deletion and reading.
  - Easy to implement.
  
- Dynamic Arrays (grow in size as array grows)
  - Flexible in size
  - Perforamance as cost for flexibility
  - Complext to implement than fixed array.
