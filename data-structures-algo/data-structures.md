## Data Structures

### Arrays

Collection of elements. Also called with names Vectors, Tuples.
    - One dimensional array
    - Two dimensional array
    
####Usage
- Used to implement lookup tables.
- Implement lists and Strings.
- Many databases consist of 1-D arrays whose elements are records.
- Implment heaps, hash tables, deques, queues, stacks and VLists.

####Types of Arrays
- Static Arrays (fixed size)
  - Have O(1) insertion, deletion and reading.
  - Easy to implement.
  
- Dynamic Arrays (grow in size as array grows)
  - Flexible in size
  - Perforamance as cost for flexibility
  - Complext to implement than fixed array.
  
#### Problems on Arrays

- Find missing number in array of continuous elements from 1 to n.
- Sort a given array
- Sort elements by frequency in an array
- Merge 2 sorted arrays
- Merge 2 unsorted arrays
- Find median of 2 sorted arrays
- Max sum such that no 2 elements are adjacent
- Check if array contains a number
- Find largest and smallest number in an unsorted array
- Find pairs whose sum is equal to given sum
- Find repetitive numbers in array if it contains duplicates
- Remove duplicate elements from an array
- Find an element which repeated only once while all others repeated twice
- Find top 2 elements from unsorted array
- Rearrange positive and negetive numbers in sorted order
- Find sub array with max sum in an array of pos and neg number
- Find length of longest sequence in an array
- Reverse an array
